# Speed Pong! (WWDC19)

Accepted submission for [WWDC19 Scholarships](https://wwdc.github.io/2019)

**Based on classic Pong with additional features:**

* Time limit - ball must be hit 10 times before time runs out. Points awarded accordingly based on playersâ€™ speeds. Time limit decreases every 10 points. Like the name suggests, time is of the essence.
* Red zone - Part of wall mirroring paddle movement; when hit, time limit is shortened. Players are discouraged from hitting the ball horizontally.
* Wall physics - Ball always travels at an angle when colliding (excluding paddle). Players given more opportunities to score/lose as ball reaches them faster.
* Touch controls - Emulate up/down movement of the original by tapping the top/bottom half of the game respectively. Familiarise players of Pong's previous incarnations quickly.
